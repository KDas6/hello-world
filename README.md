Hello-World project for the ANLY 560 assignment on GitHub

## Introduction
I am Kinjal and I am live in Pittsburgh, PA.

I am a Product Manager at ServiceLink (part of Fidelity group) and I manage portfolio of products focused on Data Science products. ServiceLink handles mortgage transactions end to end and we operate in 50 states in United States.

I completed my MBA from Carnegie Mellon and I am adding Analytics masters to enable me to be Data Product Manager. We have sizable data science team and we are expanding.

Fun fact : I am first PM hire in the history of the company and we are 25 year old company.

Before my MBA, I built middle tier applications and web applications mainly in Java and related technologies for 9 years. I cofounded a company and sold it during my MBA days.

Even though, my job doesn't require me to code but I love coding and it is more of stress reliever for me. 

Excited to be part of this class.
